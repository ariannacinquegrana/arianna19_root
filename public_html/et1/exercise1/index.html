    <h2>I 3D printed a music note!</h2>

    <p> I had to think about what would best describe myself and I thought of music. 
        Music speaks to my soul and it motivates me throughout my day.
        I love listening to music and I always listen to music while doing everything. 
        My love for music grows with me as I get older as I find it an escape from reality. 
        My peers also can relate with me and we sometimes compare each other's playlists. 
        Therefore, I decided to 3D print a music note and designing it on Fusion was simple and fast to get done.
        I designed two small circles apart from eachother and added a bar on top of each circle and then a bar connecting
        those two bars.</P>
