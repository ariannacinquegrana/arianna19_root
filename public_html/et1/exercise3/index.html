    <h2>Exercise 3: Movement Project </h2>
        <h2>I 3D printed a perfume bottle!</h2>
        <p> I decided to 3D print a perfume bottle for my final project because I thought it would be a fun and a creative idea. 
            I thought it was a unique idea because it matches my style. I copied the same shape of a Victoria Secret bottle and I added a cap to it.
