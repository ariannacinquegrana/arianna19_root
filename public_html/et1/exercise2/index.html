    <h2>I 3D printed a coaster!</h2>

   <p>I decided to 3D print a coaster because it's functional and it's something that I would use a lot.
      I also thought it was a unique idea and I thought it would be cool to add it to my living room. 
      Designing the coaster was simple and fast to get done. I designed a big circle and four little 
      circles under the big circle for it to stand. </p>
