    <h1>LIA Final Project</h1>

    <body bgcolor="lightgrey"></body>

</p>My LIA Project for Emerging Tech 1 is with my partner Nai and were creating a short stop motion ad for the MultiMedia program.
    We're making the logos for each tool we use (Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Visual Studio Code, Fusion, Blender) on Fusion so 
    they will be little characters in the stop motion talking to eachother.
    In the stop motion, Photoshop and Lightroom will be gossiping about Blender and Blender will hear them and interrupt their conversation.
    Then, the plushies hear their conversation and interfere and calm the situation down with saying that all of them are equal
    and all the tools are needed for each other to make the program be the program that it is.</p>
