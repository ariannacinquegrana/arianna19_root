<p>There were three little macarons who were triplets, 
    each a delicate pastel color one was soft pink, another a pale lavender, 
    and the third light sky blue. Despite their differences in flavor strawberry, 
    lavender honey, and blueberry they shared an unbreakable bond. They spent their 
    days rolling around the bakery together, giggling as they tumbled into one another, 
    their crunchy exteriors and creamy fillings always perfectly matched. Though they were small, 
    they had the biggest hearts, spreading joy to anyone who tasted them, and always reminding 
    each other that they were sweetest when together.</p>
